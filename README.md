# Ex.No.10
Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Date: 22/10/25
## Reg. No. 212222210004

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
---

## **Apparatus / Tools Required:**

* ChatGPT or any other Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI tool
* Internet connection
* Text editor or word processor

---

## **Theory:**

Prompt engineering plays a vital role in generating structured and meaningful content using AI models. Business reports and case studies demand formal tone, analytical reasoning, and clear organization. Using prompt patterns like **decision-making**, **comparative**, and **SWOT-based prompting**, the AI can be guided to produce professional-grade reports.

Different prompting techniques serve distinct purposes:

* **Decision-Making Prompts:** Help the AI choose between multiple strategic options.
* **Comparative Prompts:** Instruct the AI to evaluate two or more business cases or products.
* **SWOT-Based Prompts:** Guide the model to analyze Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats for a company or idea.
* **Semantic Filtering:** Ensures that the tone, structure, and vocabulary align with professional business writing standards.

By combining these techniques, users can generate well-organized, factual, and insightful business documents.

## **Procedure:**

1. **Introduction to Prompt Patterns:**
   Understand the following patterns and their roles in report generation:

   * **Query Decomposition:** Breaks complex problems into smaller queries.
   * **Decision-Making Prompts:** Instructs AI to select or justify strategic options.
   * **Comparative Prompts:** Evaluates alternatives or competitors.
   * **SWOT-Based Prompts:** Structures analytical reports with SWOT framework.
   * **Answer Engineering:** Specifies formatting and structure for clarity.
   * **Semantic Filter:** Maintains professional tone and relevance.

2. **Choosing the Content Type:**
   Select a content type relevant to the business domain:

   * Business report (e.g., market trend analysis)
   * Case study (e.g., success story of a startup)
   * Feasibility report or industry study

3. **Creating the Prompts:**

   * Begin with simple prompts like “Write a business report on electric vehicle market trends.”
   * Refine by adding complexity: “Include a SWOT analysis and compare market share growth between India and China.”
   * Apply **semantic filters** for tone and factual correctness: “Use formal business English with a data-driven perspective.”

4. **Generating and Refining Outputs:**

   * Use iterative prompting to refine the structure, accuracy, and insights.
   * Introduce decision-making elements like: “Based on SWOT, recommend the best market expansion strategy.”

5. **Review and Evaluation:**
   Evaluate generated outputs for:

   * **Coherence:** Logical flow and organization of ideas.
   * **Professional Tone:** Appropriateness for business contexts.
   * **Analytical Depth:** Use of reasoning and supporting data.
   * **Accuracy:** Realistic and factual insights.

## **Test Case Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1:** *Business Report on Market Trends – Electric Vehicles in India*
**Scenario 2:** *Case Study on Business Success – Zomato’s Expansion Strategy*

---

### **Example Prompts and Outputs**

**Prompt 1 (Basic):**
“Write a report on the growth of the electric vehicle market in India.”

**Prompt 2 (Refined – Using Comparative Prompt):**
“Compare the growth of the electric vehicle market in India with China, including factors such as government policies, technology adoption, and consumer preferences.”

**Prompt 3 (Advanced – Using SWOT & Decision-Making):**
“Prepare a professional business report on the Indian electric vehicle market using SWOT analysis. Include recommendations for market entry strategies for a new EV startup.”

**Generated Insights (Expected Output Summary):**

* **Strengths:** Government incentives, growing consumer awareness.
* **Weaknesses:** Limited charging infrastructure, high cost.
* **Opportunities:** Urbanization, eco-friendly trends.
* **Threats:** Competition from established brands, import dependency.

---

## **Observations:**

* Structured prompting improved the analytical clarity of reports.
* Decision-making and SWOT-based prompts enhanced the reasoning and strategic insight.
* Comparative prompts resulted in more comprehensive evaluations.
* The tone became more formal and data-oriented as semantic filters were applied.

---

## **Result:**

By applying structured prompt patterns such as decision-making, comparative, and SWOT-based prompts, business reports and case studies were generated with greater depth, accuracy, and professionalism. The experiment successfully demonstrated that refined prompting leads to higher-quality and more contextually appropriate outputs.

---

## **Conclusion:**

This experiment proves that structured prompt engineering significantly enhances the quality of AI-generated business content. Techniques like decision-making prompts, comparative prompts, and SWOT-based analysis help in generating coherent, insightful, and professional business documents. These prompt patterns are effective tools for content creators, researchers, and corporate analysts to produce well-structured reports and case studies with improved analytical value.
